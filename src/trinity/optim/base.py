"""Base trainer interface for pluggable training methods.

The coordinator head + SVF scales are trained by sep-CMA-ES by default.
This module defines the abstract interface that any alternative trainer
must implement (e.g., GRPO, PPO, supervised fine-tuning, random search).

To add a new trainer:
1. Subclass ``BaseTrainer``.
2. Implement ``train(policy, pool, tasks, **kwargs) -> dict``.
3. Add a CLI flag to ``train.py`` to select your trainer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        policy:
            A ``CoordinatorPolicy`` with encoder already loaded on GPU.
            The trainer calls ``policy.configure(theta)`` to install
            candidate parameters and ``policy.decide(text)`` to route.
        pool:
            Async LLM pool client exposing ``async chat(model, messages, ...)``.
        tasks:
            Training tasks. The trainer is responsible for minibatch
            sampling and evaluation scheduling.
        **kwargs:
            Training hyperparameters (population size, generations, etc.).

            - ``"best_theta_path"`` (str): path to saved best_theta.npy
            - ``"run_dir"`` (str): directory with all run artifacts
